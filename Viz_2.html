                  Issued By: The Road Safety Authority
                  Information relating to the important features such as VehicleMake, YearofBirth, Total, PASS, PASS % and FAIL, FAIL% are provided.
                  Its a big data set containing 8000+ entries of Vehicles tested by the NCT in the year 2016.

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">This combination of line and area charts show the sum of Total, Pass, and Fail Test cases over the years.
                  The chart is plotted on a shared x-axis encoding the Year of Manufacture. Along the y-axis the Number of Test cases for Total, Fail and Pass are plotted accordingly.
                  Each point for every year indicates the sum of all the Test cases carried out in that year.</td>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">The trend shows that during 90's there were more failed cases compared to pass.
               This trend continues till the year 2006. After 2006, it can be observed that there is a shift in the curve.
                  Passed cases exceeded the fail cases. This trend has continued till date.</td>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">
                  I have used line chart and area chart to plot the graphs. The main reason is, here we are comparing a Ordinal value .i.e Year of Manufacture against a Quantitative data.
                  To carry out such Time series analysis, Line graphs are the best choice. And also, I am comparing three Quantitative data against time. So, I have used 3 different layers to show the differences.
                  The color choice for each quantity is shown in the legend. Light blue color to indicate Total cases because it's a sum of Pass and Fail cases. Green color is used to indicate the Pass, which is used to indicate the positive values.
                  Similarly, red color is used for Fail cases.

                  Alternatively, the same could've been achieved by using layer of bar charts stacked upon each other instead of the line and area charts.
                  To compare the trend over time, Line charts are the most suitable than bar charts.

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">The transformation is done using vega-lite.
               Firstly, the whole data set is grouped according to the Year of Make.
                  Secondly, the sum of Total, Pass, and Fail cases are calculated.
                  Lastly, Test cases carried out after the year 1974 are selected as the number of Test cases are considerably more compared to previous years.
