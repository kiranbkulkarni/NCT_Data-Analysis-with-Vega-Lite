                  Issued By: The Road Safety Authority

                  This series of graphs shows that most of the fail items have followed the same trend over years with exceptions.
                  The shape of the area is almost similar to each other except Emmissions, Suspension, Others and Incompletables.
                  Year's where the trend reaches the peak are marked.

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">
                  Idea here is to compare each fail item with each other and to find the similarities and differences over time.
                  To plot a trend against Time, I have used a area plot. Alternatively, a line plot can also be used. When the number of plots increase, it's hard to find the differences in case of line plot. This problem can be solved when it's a area graph.
                  The area is filled with blue color which increases the readability and gives the power to distinguish between the graphs for the user.

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">Firstly, each fail item is grouped over years.
                  Secondly, the sum of fail item for each year is calculated.
                  Lastly, the series of each fail item against the years are plotted.
