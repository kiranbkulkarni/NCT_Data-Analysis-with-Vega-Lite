                  Issued By: The Road Safety Authority
                  Information relating to the important features such as VehicleMake, YearofBirth, Total, PASS, PASS % and FAIL, FAIL% are provided.
                  Its a big data set containing 8000+ entries of Vehicles tested by the NCT in the year 2016.

               Whereas, among the Top 20, SUZUKI takes the last place. FORD, SKODA, TOYOTA follows the Volkswagen with almost same average.
               Surprsingly, Asian car makers such as HYUNDAI, HONDA, SUZUKI are at the bottom.</td>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">To depict the Quantitatitve information, I have used Bar charts. To increase the usability and visibility, I have sorted the bars in the descending order.
               By looking at the graph, it can be easily determined which Vehicle maker has the highest and lowest Emission tests. Blue color with contrasting hues are used to fill the bars. For easy identification the Vehicle maker with highest rate has been highlighted.

               Since, there are 100+ car makers listed in the data set. It's not easy to represent them in the bar chart and also it affects the readability of the graph.
               This is the main reason why only Top 20 Vehicle Makes are considered. A line plot with points highlighting each value for different vehicle makes could have been used instead of bar chart. But, order of the data matters in line plot. It's not possible to show the trend.</td>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">The transformation is done using Python. The transformed dataset has been included in the directory.
               Firstly, the whole data set is grouped according to the Vehicle.
                  Secondly, the quantitative data Emmissions is aggregated using mean() for each Vehicle Make.
                  Lastly, the Top 20 Vehicle makers sorted in the descending order are selected.
